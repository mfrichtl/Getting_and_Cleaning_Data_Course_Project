# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project Repo

The script in this repo reads and analyzes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The data was collected from 3-axis accelerometers in smartphones.
This dataset was developed by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, and Luca Oneto at the Smartlab - Non-Linear Complex Systems Laboratory at the Univserity of Genoa in Genoa, Italy.

The script will generates a tiday dataset, output to "sorted_data.txt," that summarizes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset by subject and activity, with mean and standard deviation X-, Y-, and Z-axis data collected from the smartphones.

The variables in "sorted_data.txt" are described in the file "codebook.txt."

"sorted_data.txt" contains a tidy dataset because each row is an observation and each column is a variable.
