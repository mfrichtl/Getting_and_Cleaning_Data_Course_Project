This is the codebook for the tidy dataset "sorted_data.txt".  
The original data was pulled from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.  
Information on this dataset can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  

The variables in this dataset are means of the all mean and standard deviation measurements in the original dataset that have been grouped by subject and activity.  

The variables are as follows:  

1. activity  
    WALKING  
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS  
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS  
    SITTING  
    STANDING  
    LAYING  
    
2. subject  
    1-30 .Number of the subject performing the test.  

The following variables all contain both mean() and std() columns. They represent the mean of the mean() and std() columns from the original dataset
